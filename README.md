# mevn-stack
This is the basic wireframe project that we're going to use to create our dashboard.

## Project setup

Run this in both the root folder and dev-server

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
To start both the front end and back-end from the same terminal, cd to root dir and run:
```    
    npm run dev
```
Or to run both from separate terminals use: 
```    
    npm run serve
```
in the root folder and 
```
    npm run start
```
in the dev-server folder.

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

I have disabled lint for now.

```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
